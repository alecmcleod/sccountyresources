## Purpose
---
Santa Cruz County Resources aims to solve the problem of having no center of information
concerning homeless services in Santa Cruz County. There are many service providers offering
things such as food, showers, housing aid, legal services, drug rehabilitation, amongst many
others, and many of the services are only offered at certain times during the week, or on certain
days. SCCR will provide a calendar that will provide the closest and soonest service in a
particular category. If you need food, you will be able to enter your location, and it will provide
you with the soonest open soup kitchen or food bank near your location.
