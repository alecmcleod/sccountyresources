      <h5 class="">About Santa Cruz County Resources</h5>
      <p class="card-text">Our programs began on the corner of Coral and River Street in Santa Cruz in the
          1980s as a loosely affiliated group of faith-based and secular organizations providing basic food
          and shelter to people experiencing homelessness. They have evolved into four emergency and transitional
          housing shelters for nearly 230 people, a medical clinic, and a 12-bed medical respite care facility.
          <br /><br />
          People experiencing homelessness are the most vulnerable members of our community.
          They lack access to health care as well as housing, job opportunities, community connections,
          and other advantages. They often have chronic illnesses made worse by their challenging living
          conditions. Based on a study conducted in San Francisco, it can cost a community as much as
          $61,000 for a chronically homeless person who lives on the streets for one yearâ€”for expenses
          such as shelter stays, jail time, and emergency room visits.
          <br /><br />
